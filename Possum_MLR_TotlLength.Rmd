Best model = mod 3 = lm(totlngth~site+Pop+sex+skullw+footlgth+belly, data = possum_length)

Results: A multiple regression model containing site+Pop+sex+skullw+footlgth+belly explained 53.67% of the variance in total length (F=15.39[7,93], p<0.0001). PopVic had a significant negative effect on total length (t= -4.039, p= 0.0001) and footlgth had a significant positive effect (t= 4.783 , p<0.0001), but overall the model was not accurate due to the relatively low r^2.
